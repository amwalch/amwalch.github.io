        <h1>Franklin Gothic vs. Trade Gothic </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Franklin Gothic</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             
			 <p>Franklin Gothic is a sans-serif typeface designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1902 for the American Type Founders (ATF). It is part of the larger Gothic (or grotesque) type classification, which refers to early sans-serif typefaces that were popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 1970s and 80s, ITC Franklin Gothic was released, expanding the family with additional weights and styles. Today, Franklin Gothic is available in numerous digital formats and is still widely used in publishing, branding, and advertising.</p>
             <p>Franklin Gothic has been used by major brands, newspapers, and institutions, including The New York Times, PBS, and Nike. It remains a staple in typography due to its versatility, readability, and strong visual impact.</p>


			 <h3>Trade Gothic</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Trade Gothic is a sans-serif typeface designed by Jackson Burke in 1948 for Linotype. Unlike the more uniform sans-serifs of its time, Trade Gothic features an uneven, slightly condensed structure, making it distinctively quirky and dynamic compared to other grotesque typefaces. The typeface was developed incrementally over time, with Burke adding more weights and styles throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 2009, Akira Kobayashi redesigned and expanded the typeface under Trade Gothic Next, refining the original quirks while maintaining its distinctive character.</p>
			 <p>Trade Gothic is widely used in editorial design, corporate branding, and advertising. Companies like Nike, Samsung, and the New York Times have used variations of Trade Gothic in their branding. Its condensed weights are especially popular for posters and headlines, where space efficiency and bold impact are needed.</p>
